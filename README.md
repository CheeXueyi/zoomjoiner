# zoomjoiner
This is my first project in 2020 that got me into coding

zoomjoiner is a python script that joins zoom classes automatically by reading an excel sheet as input. It does this by temporarily taking control of your mouse and keyboard to replicate one's action when joining a password protected zoom class.

This script is not developed to function perfectly across many different devices, just a project that I did for my own use, so it might or might not work for others.
